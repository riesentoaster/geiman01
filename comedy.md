# COMEDY EXAM PART 2: WRITING TASK (30 points)
## TASK
Look at the background information below; then read the introduction that has already been written for you. Now finish the report.
In the findings, describe THREE areas in which your company has been operating unethically.
Then add a conclusion and recommend what the company could do as a first step to improve their ethical image.
Your report should be 200-220 words.

### BACKGROUND

Your manager has asked you to investigate corporate social responsibility (CSR) and why your company has been unsuccessful in generating an ethical image. Write a report analysing three areas in which your company has been operating unethically. You could consider the following areas:

* employment policies
* environmental policies
* treatment of suppliers
* treatment of customers

### Introduction

The purpose of this report is to analyse the reasons why our company has an unethical image by evaluating three areas. A recommendation will also be made on how this could be improved.

### Findings
To begin with, our employment policies are outdated. Most of our workers are paid less than minimum wage and have a 50-hour week. Additionally, we do not provide any social benefits to them. 


Secondly in our environmental policies we do not meet regulations. Most of our factories use outdated machinery, which pollutes the environment. There is only one facility which we use to show on inspections. This is known to the public, but we keep it under the radar by bribing local authorities. 


The last area are our customer policies. Due to being the sole manufacturer of cars in the country we demand unreasonably high prices. For products that are manufactured quite poorly. And we do not listen to recommendations from the public.

### Conclusion

The reckless profit optimising in our company has led to an absurd standard on ethical decisions. It has come to a point where more time and money is spent on trying to cover up illegal and unethical activities, than it would cost to just meet a bare minimum standard.
### Recommendation
Instead of trying with all might to circumvent ethical policies, we should focus on modernising our production process and use the money it will save us in the long run to implement ethical policies.
