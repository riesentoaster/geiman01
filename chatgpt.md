### Origin Story

Once a humble computer science professor, Bohnert stumbled upon the world of open source software when he was tasked with finding a cheaper alternative to the proprietary software used by his university. As he delved deeper into the open source community, he discovered the joys of using Vim, a text editor that only the coolest coders use.

But Bohnert's newfound passion for open source was put to the test when he realized that tech giant Apple had been shamelessly stealing code from the community. As a passionate advocate for open source, Bohnert knew he had to take action. He spent countless sleepless nights coding and debugging, determined to find a way to protect the open source community from Apple's theft.

One day, while working on his latest project, Bohnert found himself lost in thought, staring at his computer screen. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck his office, and he felt a strange surge of energy coursing through his body. It was then that he realized he had been imbued with the power of open source. From that day on, Bohnert became the Open Source Man, using his coding skills and his newfound powers to defend the open source community against Apple's thievery.

With Vim as his weapon of choice and his unwavering commitment to open source as his guiding principle, Bohnert became a hero to coders everywhere. He continued to battle against Apple's theft, always pushing the boundaries of what was possible with open source technology.

Despite the challenges he faced, Bohnert never gave up. He knew that only by staying true to his principles could he truly make a difference in the world of tech. And so, with Vim at his fingertips and the power of open source in his heart, Bohnert continued to fight the good fight, inspiring others to join him in the battle for a more open, accessible, and just tech industry.
